In Laravel you can use eloquent function, to check the date with functions `whereDay()`, `whereMonth()`, `whereYear()`, `whereDate()` and `whereTime()`.

```php
$users = User::whereDate('created_at', '2018-01-31')->get();
$users = User::whereMonth('created_at', '12')->get();
$users = User::whereDay('created_at', '31')->get();
$users = User::whereYear('created_at', date('Y'))->get();
$users = User::whereTime('created_at', '=', '14:13:58')->get();
```
