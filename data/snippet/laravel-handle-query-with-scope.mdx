You can handle repeated query in controller using laravel `Scope`

your model
```php
public function scopeActive($query) {
    return $query->where('active', 1);
}
```

your controller
```php
$users = User::active()->get();
```


 ## Combine and chain Query Scopes in Eloquent
your model
```php
public function scopeActive($query) {
    return $query->where('active', 1);
}

public function scopeRegisteredWithinDays($query, $days) {
    return $query->where('created_at', '>=', now()->subDays($days));
}
```

your controller
```php
$users = User::registeredWithinDays(30)->active()->get();
```
